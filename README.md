# Human Detection Web App

This is a web-based application for detecting humans in images using computer vision techniques. The application is built with Flask, a Python web framework, and uses OpenCV and NumPy libraries for image processing and feature extraction. The user interface is designed with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a modern and responsive experience. The application allows users to upload images and see the results of human detection, including bounding boxes around detected humans. The project also includes a trained model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve high accuracy.

## Installation

To run this application locally, you will need to have Python 3 and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5000/`. You can access the web interface by opening your web browser and navigating to this address.

## Usage

To use the application, simply upload an image using the upload button on the web interface. The application will then process the image and display the results of human detection, including any detected humans and their bounding boxes.
